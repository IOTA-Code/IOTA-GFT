# IOTA-GFT Shield
----------------------------
The IOTA-GFT Arduino shield includes the GPS receiver and driver circuit for the LED.  This shield is designed for and requires an Arduino Mega 2560 R3 board.  The IOTA-GFT controller consists of this shield mounted on an Arduino Mega.  This repository carries the Eagle design files for the shield.
